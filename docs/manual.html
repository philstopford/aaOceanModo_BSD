<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
  <img src="images/intro.png" width="496" height="351" alt=""/>
  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The aaOcean library was developed by Amaan Akram and is an
implementation of Jerry Tessendorf's 2004 paper on simulating ocean waves. Version 2.6 of the library is the foundation of the
port for MODO. </p>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean for MODO consists of two separate plugins, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Note that,
due to the way the plugins work in MODO, identical settings may not give the exact same results between plugins (e.g deformer has different operating conditions than the texture system).</p>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean is <u>not</u> an ocean shader.</p>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">This revision of aaOcean is BSD-licensed.</p>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Release 1.1.0 moves to the BSD library. It revises the texture
internals to better map the output of the ocean library on to surfaces. Wave height is once more available due to the changes
made. Foam is available, but is not quite right yet. Documentation errors for the surface tension were also corrected. <b><u>Compatibility with previous
releases is not available</u></b>.</p>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Release 1.1.1 fixes the known defects in 1.1.0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>foam is now applied correctly</li>
    <li>side-by-side installation with previous 1.0.x versions of aaOcean is working on Windows and Linux (Mac is proving troublesome).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Note that look-and-feel is not maintained, due to an unavoidable code adjustment related to the foam fix.</p>

<a name="requirements"></a>
<h1 class="western">Requirements</h1>
<blockquote>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean for MODO is built in its default configuration for MODO 901 (a MODO 701/801 kit will depend on
requests). It's available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.</p>
</blockquote>


<a name="installation"></a>
<h1 class="western">Installation</h1>
<blockquote>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean for MODO is delivered as a kit. You can install aaOcean to your user Scripts folder
or to the MODO kit folder by following the instructions below.</p>

<h2 class="western">Install Location</h2>
<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Launch MODO.</li>
<li>From MODO's 'System' menu, select 'Open User Scripts Folder'</li>
<li>A file browser opens in that folder.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the folder in the kit archive into that location</li>
<li>Restart MODO</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<a name="installation_mac"></a>
<h2 class="western">Mac OS X - Additional Steps</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The Mac version is built against Yosemite (10.11), but should
work back to Mountain Lion (10.7). It's only been tested on 10.11, however.
Note that sharing kit locations across networks (e.g. via mounted network
shares) causes issues for the aaOcean kit on this platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="installation_windows"></a>
<h2 class="western">Windows - Additional Steps</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The Windows version is built using Microsoft's Visual C++ 2015
system (update 1). That requires updated runtime libraries on this platform
(x64). They can be downloaded and installed from Microsoft's site here : <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49984">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49984</a></p>
</blockquote>

<a name="installation_linux"></a>
<h2 class="western">Linux - Additional Steps</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Debian Jessie was used to compile this
plugin. It makes use of libgomp for the OpenMP implementation; this may need to be manually
installed.</p>

</blockquote>

<a name="generalinformation"></a>
<h1 class="western">General aaOcean Information</h1>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean works, behind the scenes, in a
pretty general manner. It generates a tile, the dimensions of which are set by
the ocean size value and the detail of which is set by the resolution value.
This tile is repeated over the geometry/surface as needed.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Common parameters are discussed here. Outputs are discussed under
each respective implementation because the implementation defines the available
outputs and how they can be used.</p>

<h2 class="western">Inputs</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Output Type</u> : Choose the output type (not
available for all aaOcean implementations)</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Resolution</u> : Choose the map size
to set the amount of detail. Larger values will provide more detail, but take
significantly longer to evaluate and require more memory. They may also give
the impression that MODO has frozen. Give it time. See additional notes for the
deformer with regard to this setting.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Ocean size</u> : The physical size of the ocean tile
that is being generated.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave height</u> : This defines the wave height,
essentially a contrast control for the wave patterns.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Surface Tension</u> : Drives the existence of
capillary waves (ripples)</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wind Align</u> : Stretches the waves perpendicular to
the direction of the wind.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Smoothing</u> : Smooths out the surface, removing smaller waves from big ones.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave Direction</u> : Angular setting to control the
prevailing direction of the waves.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave Reflection</u> : By default, the ocean will have
no prevailing direction of travel for the waves. You can use this control to
change that. A value of 1 will completely eliminate waves traveling in the
opposite direction to the wind.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave Speed</u> : Controls the speed of the waves
traveling over the surface. Increasing the ocean size will seem to slow down
the waves, as they will have a longer distance to travel.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Chop</u> : This controls the
sharpness of the peaks of the waves. Higher values sharpen the tops. If you set
the value too high, the tops of the waves will self-intersect.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave Size</u> : Sets the wave size,
as you might expect.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Ocean Depth</u> : This can be changed, but has a
relatively minor effect on the ocean.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Seed</u> : This is used to initialize
the random number generator. You can use this to change the Ocean; if you find
a value you like, you can use this in the same context in a different scene to
get the exact same result.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Repeat Time</u> : The time at which the ocean
animation should repeat, in seconds.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Do foam</u> : Where applicable, this enables foam
generation for the ocean. This is required for the foam output type to be
operable.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Foam Maximum</u> : Defines the set point for foam.
This is explained in a dedicated section later in the manual.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Foam Range</u> : Defines the amount of foam to be
generated around the set point. This is explained in a dedicated section later
in the manual.</p>

<a name="deformer"></a>
<h1 class="western">Deformer</h1>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The deformer works against any mesh item that contains vertices.
It has the benefit of providing immediate feedback in the viewport, working
with the MODO deformer stack and also enabling vertex-based constraints of
items (e.g. buoys, boats). It does require a dense mesh to provide convincing
close-ups. You can use this with subdivision surfaces - the deformer will
affect the cage.</p>

<a name="deformerinputs"></a>
<h2 class="western">Implementation Notes for Inputs</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Resolution</u> : in this mode, the
final resolution of your ocean will of course depend on the number of vertices
in your mesh. The resolution value only defines the granularity of the ocean
map used to calculate the deformation. Increasing the ocean resolution on a low
density mesh will not improve the output.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Ocean size</u> : this defines the real world ocean
size from which the vertices on your mesh are processed. Note that your ocean
size should be an integer multiple of your edge length if you want to tile
instances to make a sweeping ocean vista. If this is not the case, the edges
will not align and there will be gaps in the result.</p>

</blockquote>

<a name="deformeroutputs"></a>
<h2 class="western">Outputs</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The deformer only uses the displacement outputs of the aaOcean library.
There is no output support for extended features (e.g. foam, eigenvectors) due to architectural limitations in MODO.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">aaOcean for MODO allows you to take
advantage of MODO's order of operations system to stack deformers. In this way,
you can use a bend effector to create looming waves, a vortex effector to create whirlpools,
etc.</p>

  <img src="images/deformer_stack.png" width="496" height="313" alt=""/>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<a name="texture"></a>
<h1 class="western">Texture</h1>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The texture system is the fastest way of generating displacement
for the ocean. You can take a simple quad poly and generate enormous oceans
with compelling detail. Vector displacement is recommended over Ôdisplacement'
in order to provide convincing Ôchop' effects.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The texture implementation of aaOcean
for MODO also works pretty similarly to most texture items in MODO, with one
exception when used for vector displacement effects - see Ôwave height' in the
input section below.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Using the output type setting, you have the option of choosing
the information output in the RGB channels of the color texture. For the full
set of outputs, you will need to instance (or duplicate) the texture multiple
times and this will incur additional memory and computation expense.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Note also that you won't see any viewport updates from this
texture in displacement mode - you'll need to have Preview running.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><b>Note that the texture requires a UV map in order to work, and
must be used with UV projection. Without a UV map and UV projection, the output
will be blank and no effect will be seen!</b></p>

<a name="textureinputs"></a>
<h2 class="western">Implementation Notes for Inputs</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Output type</u> : Used to select what is output by the texture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Displacement data (RGB or scalar)</li>
<li>Foam map (scalar)</li>
<li>Eigenminus vector (RGB)</li>
<li>Eigenplus vector (RGB)</li>
</ul>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Ocean size</u> : Sets the ocean size to fit within
your UV map. Note that the texture internally uses object space values, so a 
tileable effect that works across instances will be seen
when the ocean size is an integer multiple of the edge length of your square
ocean.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Wave height</u> : As noted earlier, this defines
the wave height. Note that the aaOcean texture system
works a little differently as a displacement effect. In traditional modo, the texture works with the displacement height set on
the material and the displacement is fitted to the range. In aaOcean, for vector displacement, the material displacement
height is ignored and the wave height (e.g. 4 m) will always be applied. If you
encounter clipping, increase the displacement height value on the material
being applied.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="textureoutputs"></a>
<h2 class="western">Outputs</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The texture output depends first of all on the way that the
texture layer is being used in the ShaderTree.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">In all modes of the texture layer, the value and alpha outputs
are processed. The alpha is always set to 1.0 and the value output is always
the Y displacement of the Ocean.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">In color/vector modes, the texture layer output varies based on
the Output Type set for the ocean texture. In vector displacement mode, the red/green/blue channels are set
to the respective displacement amounts in XYZ. In eigenvector modes, the output
is the XYZ vector (in RGB form).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name="channelmodifier"></a>
<h1 class="western">Channel Modifier</h1>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The channel modifier is intended to drive features like particles
and arbitrary item positioning based on the ocean configuration. The output is
perfectly matched to the texture plugin for the same inputs, but the evaluation
will generally be slightly slower. The controls and outputs are identical to
the texture plugin. Some notes are below in the case you want to drive
surfacing with the channel modifier :</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the Sample Position World Position X and Z inputs to input X and input Z on the channel modifier.</li>
<li>Driving displacement on the surface will be challenging because the aaOcean coordinate system is not intrinsically
compatible with the displacement system in modo. There does not appear to be exposed functionality to convert between
 these in the schematic at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The channel modifier exposes additional vector outputs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Min : the minimum X, Y, Z values of the bounding box of the aaOcean values. Note that these are not suitable for
animation - the range of values will vary frame-to-frame.</li>
<li>Max : the maximum X, Y, Z values of the bounding box of the aaOcean values. Note that these are not suitable for
animation - the range of values will vary frame-to-frame.</li>
<li>Normalization : the normalization values (X, Y, Z) that can
be used to map the displacement output into a 0-1 range by dividing the output
values by the corresponding normalization value. This is not going to be
consistent frame-to-frame in an animation so is limited in usefulness and may
be removed (like min, max) in a future revision.</li>
</ul>

<a name="tutorialstart"></a>
<h1 class="western">Let's Get Our Feet Wet</h1>
<blockquote>

<a name="tutorialdeformer_start"></a>
<h2 class="western">Deformer</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">We're going to start with the deformer system because it has the
advantage of displaying its results in the viewport and the ocean works based on the mesh size.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a unit plane to a mesh item. Scale it up to be 200 m on each side, centered on the world origin. If you sized the mesh item
rather than the geometry itself, freeze the transforms on the mesh item.</li>

<li>Right click the mesh item in the item list and the Use the 'Add Item' drop down menu in the item list to add aaOceanBSDDeform from the Deformers submenu.
</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_add.png" width="635" height="398" alt=""/>

<li>You should see a small shift in the viewport. It's not very convincing as an ocean, so let's subdivide the plane a few times.</li>

<li>In polygon mode, select your quad, hit Shift-D and hit return. This will turn your single quad into 4 polygons. You'll begin
to see the ocean deform. Keep subdividing and increase amounts of detail will show up, but of course your mesh will become very dense.</li>

<li>Scrub the timeline to show how the ocean characteristics change over time.</li>

<li>Change the wave height to, say, 5 m and you should begin to more clearly see the ocean effect.</li>

<li>Let's quickly review the chop effect. By default, it's set to 2.0. Switch to a top view of your mesh. You'll see that
the edges are all irregular. If you set chop to 0, the edges will become orthogonal. Chop, basically, adds lateral movement to the displacement of the vertices.
No chop means only vertical displacement is applied to each vertex.</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_chop.png" width="236" height="236" alt=""/>&nbsp;
  <img src="images/deformer_nochop.png" width="226" height="225" alt=""/>

<li>At 256 polygons, the ocean starts taking some basic shape. Let's keep subdividing to 4096 polygons. A reference is below.</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_viewport.png" width="743" height="327" alt=""/>

<li>With the ocean mesh item selected, hit the tab key on your keyboard to engage subdivision surface, giving a good smooth ocean surface</li>

<li>If you scrub the timeline now, you will be able to see the wave interactions (forward and reverse).</li>

<li>Let's add a point of interest. Add a unit sphere to the scene in a new mesh item.</li>

<li>Select the aaOceanBSDDeform entry in the item list and deselect 'Enable' to temporarily turn off the deformer.</li>

<li>Select the Sphere. Shift-select the ocean mesh.</li>

<li>From the 'Setup' workspace, under 'Modifiers' choose 'Vertex Position'. This will
set up a constraint from the ball to the nearest vertex on the ocean.</li>

<li>Re-enable the aaOceanBSDDeform deformer. You should see something like this :</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_ballconstrained.png" width="540" height="294" alt=""/>

<li>As you scrub the timeline, the ball will follow the deformed ocean. This is one of
the key benefits to the deformer mode for aaOcean. It's very easy to set up and it's trivial to create constraints for objects.</li>

<li>Now that we have a lightly detailed ocean mesh thanks to the subdivision, let's explore how the resolution parameter affects the look and feel. Go ahead and
change it from the default. Lower values evaluate extremely quickly, but lack any subtle motions that impart realism. At the higher end, impressive detail is
added, but the evaluation slows down markedly.</li>

<li>Try also adjusting the ocean size. This is where you have to pay some attention to
your settings. The ocean size relates directly to your ocean mesh size. For our
example here, the default value of 200 matches with our geometry because of the
sizing we performed in step 1. If you change the ocean size to 100, you will
see tiling in the pattern because the ocean map needs to affect the entire mesh
and so it has to repeat twice in both directions. If you make the ocean size
400, the ocean will appear blurred because a significant portion of the map is
never applied to the mesh because it falls outside the mesh itself. In general,
matching this value to your mesh size should be the first step in setting up
your ocean. Detail is added using the other settings.</li>
<ul>
<li>Note that scaling the mesh item without freezing it will not change the effect of the deformer on the ocean mesh item.</li>
</ul>

<li>The surface tension control will add the effect of ripples to the surface.</li>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Let's take a look at the wind settings.</p>

<li>Set your ocean size back to 200.0. Set resolution at the highest value you can live
with, e.g. 1024. Set wave height to 7.0 and chop to 0.0 for the moment. Set
surface tension back to 0.0, wave speed to 2.0 and wind align to 0. If you
scrub the timeline now, you'll see that the waves behave as though there is no
wind in the scene. Change Wind Align to 1 and this will change. You can use the
Wind Direction control to steer the waves.</li>

<li>The smoothing value, at higher values, will work to suppress the waves on the ocean.</li>

<li>Wave Reflection affects the amplitude of the waves traveling against the prevailing flow. At a setting of 0.0, the waves have the same amplitude in both
directions; for a value of 1.0, there are no waves traveling against the prevailing flow. You can adjust this during playback to get an idea of the
response to this control.</li>

<li>The smoothing value, at higher values, will work to suppress the waves on the ocean.</li>

<li>Wave Reflection affects the amplitude of the waves traveling against the prevailing flow. At a setting of 0.0, the waves have the same amplitude in both
directions; for a value of 1.0, there are no waves traveling against the prevailing flow. You can adjust this during playback to get an idea of the
response to this control.</li>

<li>The seed value can be used to define the input to the ocean's internal random number generator to change the ocean look for the given set of parameters.</li>

<li>Repeat Time defines the time at which the animation of the waves should loop.</li>

<li>In the deformer the 'Do Foam' options is exposed, but doesn't yield anything in the current MODO system.</li>

<li>Now, let's explore the deformer stack options for aaOcean. Go back to the item list and right click on your ocean mesh. Add a bend
effector from 'Add Deformer -&gt; Effectors' from this menu. Hop over to the Deformers list. If all went well, the Bend effector will be at the top of the
listing, with aaOceanBSDDeform at the bottom.</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_bend.png" width="743" height="356" alt=""/>

<ul>
<li>You might find some ugly shearing being displayed in the viewport - to resolve this, you need to increase the radius value of the bend.</li>
</ul>

<li>Let's adjust the bend settings on the Bend Effector (you can expand the Bend group in the Deformer list, or hop over to the Item List and select the Bend Effector
directly). The Properties panel will then show the controls we want to adjust. Choose the X axis and increase the angle.</li>

<li>Now had back over to the Deformers list and move aaOcean to the top of the list. You'll see something like below.
This is because aaOcean uses the X and Z positions of vertices to define the deformation in the Y axis, so the bend affects this and gives a different result.</li>

  <img src="images/deformer_bend2.png" width="744" height="329" alt=""/>

<li>You can also use falloffs with the aaOcean deformer. Just right click the aaOceanBSDDeform to add any falloffs that you would like to use.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="western">Texture</h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Please go through the Deformer introduction before this section.
By doing so, the basic principles will be familiar to you and we can skip to the interesting aspects of this part of aaOcean for MODO.</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with a fresh scene. As before, add a unit plane and scale it up to be a reasonable size (e.g. 20-50 m on each edge). If
you resized it in item mode, freeze the transforms.</li>

<li>Let's now jump over to the render workspace in modo . All of our work will be done here, with our single
quad ocean. Add an aaOceanBSDTexture from the aaOceanBSDTexture group in the 'Add Layer' drop-down of the ShaderTree.
The default mode is 'Diffuse Color' and we'll leave it like this for a moment. Most of the time, you will probably be using
aaOcean as a vector displacement texture, with instances as layer masks for foam layers.Head over to the Texture Locator
panel and change the projection to UV and choose the UV map from the related drop-down. The render view will show you a colorful pattern.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_initial.png" width="835" height="374" alt=""/>

<li>Let's try the vector displacement option. Right click on the aaOcean Texture row in the item list,
within the effect column and change from Diffuse Color to Vector Displacement (found under Surface Shading). You'll probably immediately be disappointed
because nothing has happened. If you are familiar with traditional displacements in MODO, you will need to take note that aaOcean
does things slightly differently.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_vecdisp_1.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<li>Change the wave height to 4 m. Nothing will appear to change.</li>

<li>On the associated material, which in this basic scene is our Base Material, find the 'Displacement Distance' parameter on the
Material Ref sheet and increase it to 10 m. This will allow our 4 m waves to be displayed. The texture defines the height, not the material. Note that very
large values in the material displacement distance parameter with cause precision errors, so make it a few multiples of your wave height.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_vecdisp_2.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<li>Change the ocean size to 50.0, making the internal map better fit our object size and crank up the resolution to something like 128 or 256.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_vecdisp_3.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<ul>
<li>Preview can sometimes get stuck and hold on to the same displacement in different frames, or only draw a very poorly evaluated mesh. If that happens, toggling the
displacement texture on and off in the ShaderTree with the eye icon will force Preview to update.</li>
</ul>

<li>Unlike HOT, increasing the resolution in aaOcean doesn't radically change the ocean shape - it just adds more detail. Note that, at the maximum setting of 4096, you'll be getting over 16 million points on the ocean map that defines the displacement! These high settings can take a while to evaluate, so if modo appears to be hanging, you might want to reduce the resolution until you come to render. Play around with the resolution setting and then, once happy, set it back to 128 or 256 and save the scene. These large texture sizes also consume considerable amounts of RAM.</li>

<li>aaOcean also works with the regular displacement mode. Sometimes, this can even work better than the vector displacement, but you will probably need to greatly reduce the wave height value (e.g. from 4.0 to 1.0) and, in this case, the displacement height on the material will be the control (so reduce it from 10 m to 4 m). Switch
over to compare the results, in the same way that you changed from Diffuse Color to Vector Displacement back in step 2. Note that sharp crests are not available except in the vector displacement texture.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_vecdisp_4.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>
</ol>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">For larger oceans, you will find that you need to blend multiple oceans of
different sizes and seeds in order to eliminate tiling whilst preserving detail in close-up shots.</p>

</blockquote>

<a name="tutorialfoam_start"></a>
<h2 class="western">Foam</h2>
<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Now let's try something more advanced: foam. Close preview and reload the scene from step (7) earlier.</li>
<li>On the base material, in the Material Ref sheet, change the diffuse color to a dark blue.</li>
<li>Add a constant texture layer and set the color to a pale blue / white. Leave it with the default diffuse color texture effect.</li>
<li>Instance the aaOcean texture layer. On the instanced layer, change the Output type to output foam. Accordingly, also set the 'Do Foam' value to 1. To soften the effect and to reduce CPU and memory load, also reduce the resolution down to 64 on this layer.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the instanced aaOcean texture layer on top of the constant to use it as a layer mask. Fire up Preview and you should get something like the image below.</li>
  <img src="images/texture_foam_1.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<li>This needs some refinement. aaOcean actually outputs a foam value for all areas of the ocean. To make this useful, we need to find the range of values that we would like to use. Best practice is to leave the range value alone and increase the max value until the foam just disappears. In the case below, the foam just disappears with a max foam value of 3.0.</li>

  <img src="images/texture_foam_2.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<li>We now start adding foam back, we concentrate on the range value. Increase it from 1.0 to 2.0</li>

  <img src="images/texture_foam_3.png" width="745" height="419" alt=""/>

<li>The image below is for a range value of 1.5.</li>

<h1 class="western">FAQ</h1>
<blockquote>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>The plugin isn't showing up in 801 (release, SP1, SP2, SP3,
etc.). Why?</u></p>
<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">This plugin is built against MODO 901 SDK. It won't show up in
earlier versions.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>I get tiling - what can I do?</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The ocean system uses tiles that are repeated over the ocean
surface. You'll need to blend multiple oceans with different seeds and sizes to
break this up. For the texture and channel modifier plugins, this is easy - you
can just stack them up. For the deformer, this presents a problem - you're best
off using the deformer for crude deformations and then using displacement or
bump mapping using aaOcean to hide the tiling from
each part.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>I don't see any displacement in my render (using displacement
or vector displacement). What's up?</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">There are several possibilities:</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">1. Check that you have a material affecting the surface and
ensure that the displacement height on this material is appropriately set (for
displacement, set this to the amplitude of the wave you would like; for vector
displacement set it to any value significantly larger than the wave height in
the texture). Due to MODO's architecture, we can't set this from the texture
plugins.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">2. The aaOcean texture, as of 1.1.0,
requires a UV projection to work. We can't do this automatically, and scenes
from earlier versions will likely have a Ôsolid' projection. Switch to a UV
projection and the texture will then work.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Linux : MODO won't start after
installing this. Why?</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">This is likely the result of at least one missing dependency.
Ensure that libgomp or its equivalent is installed, <a href="#installation_linux">Linux : Additional Steps</a></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Linux : MODO renderslaves are having trouble. Why?</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">This is likely the result of at least one missing dependency.
Ensure that libgomp or its equivalent is installed, <a href="#installation_linux">Linux : Additional Steps</a>.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Windows : I'm getting an error
that the program cannot start due to MSVCR120.DLL being missing.</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">The Windows kit is compiled using Microsoft's Visual C++ 2015
software (update 1). That requires updated runtimes on many Windows systems.
You can find a link to the installer in the Installation section, <a href="#installation_windows">Windows : Additional Steps</a>.</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%"><u>Any wake or similar functionality?</u></p>

<p class="western" style=" line-height: 100%">Not in aaOcean itself, no. However, the
channel modifier can drive particles.</p>

<h1 class="western">Known Issues in 1.1.1</h1>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>A UV map is mandatory for the texture to work, in order to support the internal mechanisms that translate the aaOcean
library output to the required values for the vector displacement.</li>

<li>Settings from scenes using aaOcean 1.0.x will not carry forward to 1.1.0 without rework.</li>

<li>Scenes from 1.1.0 will see a change in look-and-feel with 1.1.1
due to the nature of the fix for the foam tracking problem in 1.1.0.</li>

<li>Scenes from 1.0.x are not handled by 1.1.x</li>
